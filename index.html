<h3>Screamer Description: </h3>
<p>Screamer is an interactive soundboard app that plays sounds when you move your phone, such as screaming when you drop it, or lawnmower sounds when you pull it back.

<h3>CodeDay Description:</h3> 
<p>The Scream Team built Screamer in just 24 hours at CodeDay Chicago. CodeDay is an event to encourage young people to code, by locking us in a room for 24 hours and seeing what comes out. To learn more, go to <a class="copyright" text-decoration="underline" href="https://codeday.org/">Code Day's site!</a>

<h3><b>The Scream Team:</b></h3>
<p><strong>Jonathan Senese</strong> had learned a semester's worth of Java before joining Scream Team, but contributed however he could.<br>
<strong>Chris Palacios</strong> <em>bravely</em> offered his wonderful website to host the Scream Team's app. As a professional hand model, sonic screwdriver user, and Dr. Pepper drinker, he contributed with sound and video and his lovely bio.<br>
<strong>Salamander</strong> did many importants.<br>
<strong>Ricky Cushing</strong> did too.<br>
